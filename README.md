## 📖 Project Description
Radar and Track Scenario Generator (RTSG) is a simulation software designed to generate and visualize radar and track scenarios.  

The system allows users to:  
- Add multiple radars with parameters (latitude, longitude, scanning radius, angle, error factor).  
- Create track scenarios with defined start and end points.  
- Visualize radar coverage and track movement in real-time or accelerated simulation.  
- Export radar and track information into structured text files (e.g., `flights.txt`).  

🔮 **Future Enhancement:** Integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to provide 2D map support.
